expResults
==========

This package will provide tools for calculating, tabulating, and visualizing experimental results, eventually through some kind of S3 class and associated methods for `plot`, `print`, and `summary` and some integration with other experimental analysis packages. The goal of the package is to fill a niche for descriptive representations of experimental results, an area not well served by existing packages.
